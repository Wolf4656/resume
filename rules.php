          <li class="lvl4">Any glitches that freeze the game are banned, and the player who initiated the glitch is subject to forfeiture of the match.</li>
    <li class="lvl1">Other Rules</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Double Blind Character Select:</b> Either player may request a double blind character select for the first game. In this situation,
      a third party is told, in secret, each player’s character choice.Both players then select their character, and the third party validates that the
      character selected is the same as what they said.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Port Priority:</b> If an agreement cannot be made as to who gets what port, the players may enact a best-of-1 game of
      Rock Paper Scissors. Winner gets their port selection, loser selects any other port.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Neutral Start:</b> Either player may enact this rule. Once enacted, both players may only use one of the two neutral starting ports.
      A best-of-1 game of Rock Paper Scissors may be used to determine who chooses port first. If both the Port Priority and Neutral Start rules are invoked,
      the player who is granted Port Priority selects one of the neutral start ports. Neutral starting ports are only applicable to Super Smash Bros. Melee.
      For Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, players may elect to move to opposite sides of the stage and then count down prior to starting the match.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Pausing:</b>In the event that pause is not turned off, pausing the game is only legal while a player remains upon their OWN respawn platform,
      and only for the purpose of summoning a tournament organizer, or in the event of a controller malfunction. All other pauses will incur a stock loss to the
      offending player. If a pause causes an opponent to lose a stock, the offending player may be required to forfeit two stocks.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Stalling:</b>The act of stalling, or intentionally making the game unplayable, is banned and at the discretion of the TO. Stalling tactics include but
      are not limited to becoming invisible, infinites, chain grabs, or uninterruptible moves past 300%; or abusing a position in which your opponent can never reach you.
      Any action that can prevent the game from continuing (i.e., pausing, freeze glitches, disappearing characters, game reset, etc.) will result in forfeiture of that
      match for the offending player. You are responsible for knowing your own character, and must be wary about accidentally triggering these effects.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Timeouts/Ties:</b>The winner of a match that goes to time (time out) will be determined by stocks and then percentage. When the timer hits 0:00, the player
      with the higher stock count is the winner. If both players are tied in stocks, the player with the lower percentage is the winner. In the event of a percentage tie,
      or a match in which both players lost their last stock simultaneously, a 1 stock tiebreaker will be played with a 3:00 time limit. The result of the game’s built-in
      Sudden Death does not count towards the set count.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Stock Sharing:</b>is allowed in doubles. Trading controllers is not allowed.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Colorblind Clause:</b>Players may request that their opponent change colors to accommodate colorblindedness, or if their color is indistinguishable from
      either the other team color or the stage background. This request must be made before the first game of the set.</li>
      <li class="lvl2"><b>Warm-ups:</b>Warm-up periods, button checks, and “handwarmers” may not exceed 30 seconds on the game clock. Violation of this rule may result in
      an automatic forfeit at the discretion of the TO.</li>
